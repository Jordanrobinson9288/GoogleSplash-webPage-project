# Welcome to My Coding Journey ðŸš€

Hi, I'm **Jordan Robinson**. For over a decade, I've been passionate about building user experiences as a **UX/UI Designer**. Now, I'm expanding my craft to the code that brings those experiences to life as an **Aspiring Software Developer**.

I believe great applications are born at the intersection of elegant design and robust code. My mission is to master Java and full-stack development to become a builder who understands the entire process, from pixel to pipeline.

## ðŸ§  My Current Focus

I'm fully immersed in the world of **Java programming**, building a strong foundational knowledge in object-oriented principles, data structures, and algorithms. This repository documents that hands-on learning journey.

**My Toolkit:**
- **New Frontiers:** `Java`
- **Web Fundamentals:** `JavaScript` | `HTML5` | `CSS3` | `SASS`
- **Design Expertise:** `Figma` | `Adobe XD` | `User Research` | `Wireframing`

## ðŸŒŸ Why My Background is an Asset

My 10 years in design (2013-2023) mean I don't just write code; I architect solutions with a deep empathy for the end-user. I ask questions like:
* "Is this interface intuitive?"
* "How does this function impact the user's workflow?"
* "Is this accessible and performant?"

I'm learning to translate the *'why'* behind a design into clean, functional code.

## ðŸ“‚ About This Repo

This is my digital workshop. Here you'll find:
- **Learning Projects:** Exercises and small apps built while mastering new concepts.
- **Code Experiments:** Sandboxes for testing ideas and exploring technologies.
- **Future Portfolio Pieces:** As my skills grow, this will house more complex, deployed full-stack applications.

## âœ¨ A Personal Note
I've enjoyed a nomadic career, practicing design from **Seattle, WA** to **Atlanta, GA**, to **Brandon (Tampa), FL**, but now I'm calling in **Sun City, AZ** my new home. I'm excited to see where coding takes me next!
